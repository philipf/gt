# gt
GT (Go Time) is a CLI to manage time.

This is used as a learning module for Go


## Install
(There is nothing to see yet)

```bash
go install github.com/philipf/gt/cmd/gt@latest
```
## Next steps
- Revisit the code structure for the domain layer. This doesn't feel like idiomatic Go yet
- Fix error handling, using Error types

## Done  
- Update existing tests to consistently use the asserts package
